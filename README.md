# Windows Maintenance Automater (WMA)

**Windows Maintenance Automater (WMA)** is a personal project designed to automate essential Windows maintenance tasks using simple yet effective scripting. The goal is to streamline system upkeep by running key diagnostic and repair utilities such as `chkdsk`, `sfc /scannow`, and `DISM`, all within a single automated process.

This project not only simplifies Windows maintenance for users but also serves as a hands-on learning experience in scripting and automation using **Batch file programming**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

* **Automation:** Create a unified script that executes multiple maintenance operations with minimal user input.
* **System Health:** Help maintain Windows integrity and performance by routinely checking for and repairing system issues.
* **Learning Focus:** Deepen my understanding of the **Batch scripting language**, Windows command-line utilities, and automation workflows.
* **Scalability:** Build a foundation that can later be expanded with advanced features such as logging, progress indicators, or even a graphical interface.

## 🧩 Why This Project Exists

Windows maintenance often requires running multiple commands individually — which can be repetitive and time-consuming. WMA simplifies this process by combining these essential tasks into a single script, ensuring that your PC stays healthy with minimal effort.

It’s also a way for me to improve my scripting skills while creating something genuinely useful for everyday maintenance or client work.
